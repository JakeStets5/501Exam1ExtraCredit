The Tale of CIS 501,0,True

This is the tale of CIS 501., For testing purposes we are only putting a couple sentences per page. Like this page only has 2 sentences!, That doesn't mean- though- that the book can't keep going!, See now we are on page 4. Try setting a bookmark! Sadly: there are no other pages after this :(
Diary of a Wimpy Kid,2,True
4,3
This is in fact no the ACTUALLY Diary of Wimpy Kid book., Also: who even thought of naming a book series "Diary of a Wimpy Kid"?, I guess some things just catch
My Book,0,True

This is my book. If I wanted to I could write about anything., For example: I could write that I love to cook (even though I don't)., Then my book would be fictional., I guess if I was cooking aliens then it would be sci-fi. Either way I really enjoy writing books., Especially those that are in the cloud!
Jorge,0,True
1
This book is all about Jorge., He is the best professor I have ever had., This will be my third class with him because I have taken 200 308 and now 501!, Each time I have a class with Jorge I enjoy attending because of his funny jokes!, Thanks for all you do for us students
